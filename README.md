#Simon Game
#Description
The Simon Game is a memory skill game that requires players to repeat a sequence of tones and lights. The sequence becomes progressively longer and more complex with each round. The game was invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison and was released by Milton Bradley in 1978.

#How to Play

Press the any  button to begin.

Repeat the Sequence:

If you get the sequence correct, the game will add another color to the sequence and repeat it.

Game Over:

If you press the wrong button, the game will end.
Press "Start" to play again.
